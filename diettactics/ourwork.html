			<p>Weight Loss Tips Secret to Drop 5 big Pounds Weekly!<br>
			Tired of feeling out of energy and &nbsp;want to feel amazing by loosing 
			weight effortlessly and look stunning for an upcom­ing event? Do you 
			(a) accept how you look and detag Face­book pics later, (a) stop 
			eating, or (c) follow our simple plan? Yeah, we thought so.<br>The Secret Weight loss tips Exposed!<br>
			Weight Loss tips #1<br><br>Drink Mainly Water<br>A energy or sports drink, beer, or fruit 
			smoothies — each serving contains about 100 calories. Yet these 
			beverages don't satisfy you the way 100 calories of food does, so 
			they're a waste. Other liquids may be high in sodium and 
			carbohydrates, which trick your body into retaining water, puffing 
			you out.<br><br>Exception: One to 2 glasses of dry red wine per 
			night is no problem.<br><br>Water, on the other hand, has zero carbs 
			and calories, zero! &nbsp;and little to no sodium, making it the perfect 
			slim-down drink. And insanely, it actually assists in flushing out 
			excess water weight and it jump-starts your metabolism. If it's just 
			to plain, add mint leaves or yellow lemon wedges.<br>&lt;p 
			style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;Weight Loss tips #2&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;strong&gt;Do 
			Cardio 30 Minutes a Day&lt;/strong&gt;<br><br>Any workout that gets your 
			heart rate up will burn calories. But you'll use more calories if 
			you pick a cardio routine that engages multiple muscles 
			simultaneously, says Wendy Larkin, personal-training manager at 
			Crunch's Polk Street gym, in San Francisco.<br><br>Three to 
			consider: boot-camp workouts, spinning, and cardio kickboxing, &nbsp;At 
			least 10min of each torches 200 to 300 calories while toning up your 
			arms, legs, and core. You will notice everything appears sleeker and 
			tighter.<br><br>You'll burn even more calories per session if your 
			workout contains: alternating short bursts of intense cardio with 
			slower activity. Experts aren't sure why it works, but many 
			experience trainers swear by it.<br><br>A tactic that will make you 
			burn fat the fastest: &nbsp;Right when you get up&nbsp;in the morning, do 
			50&nbsp;&lt;a 
			href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise&quot;&gt;aerobic&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;jumping 
			jacks and 20 pushups. The workout combination is deadly. By engaging 
			both the cardiovascular and muscular systems first thing in the 
			morning without food in the body, you cause your body to burn tons 
			of stored fat.<br><br>This is the one exception to the 
			stick-to-water-only rule: Just as a coffee run makes your morning at 
			work more productive, a pre-exercise cup of java with a splash of 
			skim milk (about 11 calories) or black (just 5 calories) will 
			energize your workout, explains Dr. Klauer&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;You'll burn more 
			calories without realizing you're pushing yourself harder.&quot;<br><br>
			<br><br><br>Weight loss tips #4<br>Get an extra 30 minutes of beauty 
			rest.<br><br>That extra half an hour, whether you sleep 5 hours or 
			8, can refresh you enough that you will make better food choices (in 
			other words, no quick sugar fix for breakfast in search of energy) 
			and won't feel lethargic and skip the gym says 
			dietician&nbsp;experts.&nbsp;More restful sleep (7 to 8 hours is best) also 
			boosts your metabolism. If you dont have the extra 30 minutes to 
			sleep, another great weight loss tip is to take a 5 minute power nap 
			which is used to supplement sleep. &nbsp;And since your body builds 
			muscle while you sleep, getting some shut eye will amount in better 
			muscle tone..</p>
